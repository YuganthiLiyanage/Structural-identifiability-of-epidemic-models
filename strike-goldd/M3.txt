    => More Lie derivatives would be needed to see if the model is structurally unidentifiable as a whole.
    However, the maximum computation time allowed for calculating each of them has been reached.
    You can increase it by changing <<opts.maxLietime>> (currently opts.maxLietime = 100)
    => We cannot decide about parameter betaA at the moment
    => We cannot decide about parameter betaI at the moment
    => Parameter k is structurally identifiable
    => Parameter gamma is structurally identifiable
    => Parameter rho1 is structurally identifiable
